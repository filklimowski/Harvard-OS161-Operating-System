when server reads that it's a SPAWN,
broadcast it.
send COORDINATE_REQ to all clients
clients respond with COORDINATES packet.
server builds an array with [player id, x, y, d]
once the # of coordinate packets server has received = clientList.size()
send a CLIENT_LIST packet with the array [player id, x, y, d]
client receives client_list and if its not your player id, add those clients
